*[Graphene has updated to w0.4.2-s0.3.1](http://gra.phene.co)*


The update process is slowly becoming smoother, this time there _should_ be no manual edits needed.
New features include an advanced settings page (the link to which is on the settings page), hovercards (when hovering over user page links), and a feed editor (click *"Feeds"* in the sidebar).
As for fixes: the login page shows a red box when the login fails and there is a popup to verify that settings have saved.
The next update should be out in the next week, including fixes for notifications, search, user tagging, and email notifications.
