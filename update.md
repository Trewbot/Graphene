*[Graphene has updated to w0.4.1-s0.3.0](http://gra.phene.co)*

Avatars are back! Head over to your user page and check out the "Upload Avatar" button to upload one. Click "Edit Avatar" to crop it to your heart's content.
Several major fixes are also included. Timestamps no longer flash long strings of numbers, posts load when posted and loading posts no longer blocks commenting and posting.
For anyone interested in the more technical details, the Node.js module Sharp was installed to handle image manipulation and several server-side scripts were written to smooth out the update process.
See the [changelog](http://gra.phene.co/changes) for more details.
